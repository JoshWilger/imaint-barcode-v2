# Project Info

A label printing software made for modern DYMO printers during an internship at [Green Bay Packaging](https://gbp.com/). Based off a previous version made for older printers, version 2 reworks the code and project structure to implement [an updated package](https://github.com/dymosoftware/DCD-SDK-Sample) and the business's code standards. The software itself allows users to print labels for a corresponding part number in one of three label formats.
